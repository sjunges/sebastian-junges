*This website is under construction*

I am a researcher and have been a PostDoc at UC Berkeley since March 2020.

Previously, I was a PhD student at [RWTH Aachen University](https://moves.rwth-aachen.de/), under the supervision of Joost-Pieter Katoen. 
I defended my PhD thesis titled Parameter Synthesis in Markov Models in February 2020. 

## Research Interest

I am broadly interested in the automatic analysis of critical systems. This interest includes modelling and verification aspects. In particular, I am interested in the analysis of models that explicitly model uncertainty.  

Some models and methods I often work with are:
- (Probabilistic) Model checking and abstraction
- SAT and SMT solvers
- Markov decision processes (MDPs), in particular also parametric or partially observable MDPs.
- Fault trees, in particular their dynamic extensions

## Publications

For now, please refer to [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/j/Junges:Sebastian) or [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=anwAmOEAAAAJ&hl=de) for an overview of my publications.

## Tool support

Over the years, I’ve been involved in the development of the following tools to advance the state-of-the-art in computer aided verification:

- The probabilistic model checker [Storm](stormchecker.org) (since 2014) and its python bindings [stormpy](https://moves-rwth.github.io/stormpy/) (since 2016)
- The parameter synthesis framework for Markov models [PROPhESY](https://moves-rwth.github.io/prophesy/) (since 2014)
- The SMT-solver [SMT-RAT](https://smtrat.github.io) (2011 — 2015)
- The arithmetic library [carl](https://smtrat.github.io/carl/) (2012 — 2015) and its python bindings [pycarl](https://moves-rwth.github.io/pycarl/) (since 2016)
- [Compass](http://www.compass-toolset.org) (2014)

## Professional Activities

### Invited Talks

I have given invited talks at:

Moreover, I have given (external) seminar talks at ISCAS (Beijing), IST Austria, LaBRI (Bordeaux), Stanford, UC Berkeley, ULB (Brussels), and at the ROCKS Meetings.
